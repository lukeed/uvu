# Example: esm.mjs

Please read [/docs/esm](/docs/esm.md) for full details & comparisons.

## Why

This example makes use of the native ESM loader – available in version Node 12 and later!


## Highlights

* Define `import` statements with full file paths <br>Required by Node.js whenever ESM in use.
